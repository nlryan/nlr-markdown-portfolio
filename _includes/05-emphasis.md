As the Chief Executive Office of Nerdbird Farms, and Chief Nerdbird, I represent the Farm and oversee all promotional content and communications. 
I serve as an advocate of all staff and of our inclusion efforts. *At Nerdbird Farms our motto is*:
> A **TRUE** friend is someone who thinks you are a _**GOOD egg**_ even though she knows you are **slightly cracked**.
